           <p>MazeGame, as the name implies, is a game where you play as a red circle trying to navigate through a randomly generated maze. The maze is generated using <em>Prim's Recursive</em> algorithm, and is coded in Java. I made MazeGame in April 2016, when I was 15 years old. At the time, I wanted to expand my Java skills and make a game, but didn't want to use any engine or libraries for it. With the help of YouTube tutorials and Google, I was able to put the project together.</p>

           <p>OneInTheChamber is a Minecraft plugin intended to be used on a <em>Spigot/Paper</em> server. OITC is a minigame and is based off of the Call of Duty gamemode of the same name. OneInTheChamber was coded in Java. It implements the use of the Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper libraries, which are used for developing plugins for multiplayer Minecraft servers.</p>

            <p>I developed this website as practice and demonstration of my HTML, CSS, and Javascript abilities. It also acts as a place where I can aggregate all of my projects in one place, upload photos of my woodworking builds, and continue to learn and practice new web development concepts. The site is hosted by Github Pages.</p>
